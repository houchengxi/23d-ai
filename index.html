                <h3>Case Study</h3>
                <p>The following issues and coordination questions were identified in one of our projects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>North sliding door: The header shown on the drawings as a continuous piece was built as two separate headers on site. Please confirm the correct arrangement.</li>
                    <li>Staircase connection: Please confirm whether the party wall along the staircase should extend continuously to the roof on the second floor.</li>
                    <li>Beam under stairs: The beam located beneath the staircase conflicts with the stairs. Please confirm an optimized solution.</li>
                    <li>First‑floor balcony area: Varying beam heights result in the wall having three different heights. Please confirm whether this arrangement is acceptable.</li>
                    <li>First‑floor interior (north side): Beam height differences have caused exterior and interior walls to have different heights. Please confirm if the interior wall should match the height of the exterior wall.</li>
                    <li>Roof structure: Some beams rest too high on other beams, causing conflicts with the flat roof or the staircase’s exterior wall. Adjustments are required.</li>
                    <li>HVAC piping clash: Conflicts were detected in HVAC layouts in multiple levels of the building and require re‑optimization.</li>
