            <h3>1. Eliminate costly on-site errors</h3>
            <p class="muted">
              Uncoordinated plans from different consultants create clashes that
              only show up once you’re framing. That leads to emergency RFIs,
              change orders and delays.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our clash detection finds these conflicts in the 3D model before
              construction, so issues are solved on paper, not on site.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Achieve budget certainty & reduce waste</h3>
            <p class="muted">
              Inaccurate material take-offs drive budget overruns and piles of
              unused lumber on site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our 3D model generates an automated bill of materials, giving you a
              solid baseline for ordering and reducing waste.

              Ambiguous 2D plans slow down trades and create arguments in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clear, unambiguous 3D views and optimized routing make it obvious
              what needs to happen, so crews can keep moving.

            <h3>4. Access powerful tech at an unbeatable price</h3>
            <p class="muted">
              Traditional BIM software is expensive and requires specialist staff,
              which is out of reach for many smaller builders.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our automation-driven workflow and AI-assisted tools make “digital
              twin” style planning accessible to regular residential builders.

            <p class="muted">
              Poorly coordinated HVAC and sprinkler lines lead to ugly bulkheads
              and unnecessary holes in structural members.
            </p>
            <p>
              By modeling these systems in 3D, we plan routing that eliminates
              bulkheads where possible and avoids risky structural penetrations.

      <div class="card case-card">
        <h3>Why it matters</h3>
        <p>
          These are the kinds of issues that usually show up only when you’re mid-framing,
          with trades on site and schedules already tight.
        </p>
        <p>
          By surfacing them early in a 3D model, the builder was able to coordinate fixes
          with the designer and engineer in advance, avoiding:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On-site redesigns</li>
          <li>Last-minute RFIs and change orders</li>
          <li>Delays cascading into following trades</li>
        </ul>

          The result: smoother framing, fewer surprises, and a cleaner final build.
